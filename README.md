# PYQG Subgrid Forcing Experiments

![pyqg simulation animation](./eddy.gif)

## Summary

This repository contains code that uses [`pyqg`](https://pyqg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (a quasi-geostrophic ocean simulation library) to test out machine learning parameterizations as well as generate datasets for training them. It also contains associated code for training such ML parameterizations and evaluating their offline and online performance.
